crystal-build is an [crenv](https://github.com/pine/crenv) plugin that provides an crenv install command.

## Warning: This project has been replaced and is no longer in active development

It is being replaced by [crystal-build-cr](https://github.com/crenv/crystal-build-cr), which is a rewrite of this existing Perl codebase in Crystal. The Crystal replacement should satisfy the needs of anyone wanting to use `crystal-build`, so we suggest you use it instead of this repository. The rewrite is largely motivated by the previous maintainer no longer being able to maintain and find contributors for the Perl codebase. Pull requests are no longer being accepted for this repository.

## Install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pine/crystal-build.git ~/.crenv/plugins/crystal-build
```

crystal-build currently supports only download a compiled tarball.

## Usage
### Using `crenv install` with crenv

To install a Crystal version for use with crenv, run `crenv install` with the exact name of the version you want to install. For example,

```
crenv install 0.15.0
```

Crystal versions will be installed into a directory of the same name under `~/.crenv/versions`.

To see a list of all available Crystal versions, run `crenv install --list`.

### Special environment variables

- `CRYSTAL_BUILD_CACHE_PATH`, if set, specifies a directory to use for caching downloaded package files.

### Development

Tests are executed using [Carton](https://github.com/perl-carton/carton):

```
$ carton install
$ carton exec -- prove -r t # all
$ carton exec -- prove t/<dir>/<file>.t
```
